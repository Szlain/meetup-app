# Heywood Pension Technologies (HPT) Assessment

The developer assessment consists of two parts - coding challenge and interview.

The coding challenge involves working with two of our Developers (one will be acting as a Product Owner). It will take around 50 minutes. We do not expect you to complete it all.

You can then take a five minute break, before proceeding to a more traditional interview with two of our Senior Developers.

On occasion, we may need to switch the order and have the interview first.

Good luck!
